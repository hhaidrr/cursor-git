# Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

The Cursor Git extension now uses a **simplified typing speed-based heuristic** to distinguish between human and AI-generated code changes.

## Core Logic

### 1. Typing Speed Detection
- **Above 150 WPM** → AI typing
- **Below 150 WPM** → Human typing
- **Configurable threshold** via `typingSpeedThreshold` setting

### 2. Human Action Override
The following actions **always flag as human typing**, regardless of WPM:
- **Delete** - Any text removal (backspace, delete key)
- **Copy/Paste** - Large text blocks with no typing delay
- **Backspace** - Single character deletions
- **Small changes** - 1-2 character edits

### 3. Flag-Based System
- **`isHumanTyping`** boolean flag tracks current typing mode
- **`true`** = Human typing → Skip commit
- **`false`** = AI typing → Auto-commit on save

### 4. File Save Trigger
- **Only commits when file is saved** (not on every change)
- **Checks the flag** to determine if changes are AI or human
- **Commits only AI changes** automatically

## Key Features

### Real-Time Detection
- Monitors text changes as they happen
- Calculates WPM for typing sessions
- Updates flag based on speed and actions

### Session Management
- Groups related changes into sessions
- 2-second timeout between changes starts new session
- Minimum 10 characters needed for analysis

### User Action Respect
- Delete, undo, backspace immediately flag as human
- Copy/paste operations flag as human
- Small edits flag as human

### Configuration
- Adjustable WPM threshold (50-500)
- Session timeout (500-10000ms)
- Minimum characters for analysis (5-50)
- Commit frequency (immediate/onSave/manual)

## Benefits

1. **Reliable**: Based on measurable typing behavior
2. **Respectful**: Honors human editing actions
3. **Configurable**: Adjustable for different users
4. **Simple**: Clear logic that's easy to understand
5. **Efficient**: Lightweight calculations and minimal memory usage

## Usage

1. **Install** the extension
2. **Enable** auto-commit via Command Palette
3. **Code normally** - extension detects typing speed
4. **Save files** - AI changes are auto-committed

## Commands

- `Cursor Git: Enable Auto-Commit` - Enable the extension
- `Cursor Git: Check Typing Status` - Show current typing mode
- `Cursor Git: Set AI Flag` - Manually override typing mode
- `Cursor Git: Show Status` - Display all settings

*This implementation provides a robust, user-friendly way to automatically commit AI-generated changes while respecting human editing.*
